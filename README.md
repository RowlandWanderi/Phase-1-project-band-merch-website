## Project Description

    This is an app I made that allows you to review and buy an item of your choice from the Bandwagon store through the webpage using a locally made json server.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
    - Download zip in the code section of github to your desired folder
    - Extract the files
    - Open the folder with vs code.
      A json server is required for this project so we need to install it and run this command to get the backend started:

        ```sh
        json-server --watch db.json
        ```

        Test your server by visiting this route in the browser:

        [http://localhost:3000/Tshirts](http://localhost:3000/Tshirts)

    - Then run your index.html by either using the "GO LIVE" extension or by double clicking of the index.html
    - And your application is running.
